# Speedrun

The Speedrun event is all about making your ideas come to live. SwiftUI makes it easier than ever to make your designs into real apps. The design you will be recreating is one you're probably very familiar with, the camera app. It shines in it's simplicity, but it hides a lot of interesting challenges when it comes to recreating this.

# How to participate

- Download the SwiftUI Series [Speedrun Timer app](http://swiftuiseries.com/SpeedRunTimer.zip)
- Position the Timer within view and start a screen recording showing Xcode, the timer and your simulator/Preview 
- Try to recreate the Camera app screenshot below as fast and accurately as possible
- Create a new public repo for your code
- Upload your screen recording to YouTube or WeTransfer and add it in the README of your repo
- Add a reference to your project to the README of this repo and make a PR
- Make sure your speedrun is not longer than 30 min

The judges will compare your end result using [RocketSim](https://www.rocketsim.app)'s design comparison feature so maybe it comes in handy for you as well.

Once you've uploaded your code to a public GitHub repo, make a PR and add a link below.
